#ToneRowMatrix

Generates a 12 x 12 matrix showing all 48 forms of a series 

A 12 x 12 matrix is a convenient way of representing the possible transpositions, retrogrades, inversions, and retrograde-inversions of a tone row used in a 12-tone composition. To generate a matrix, run ToneRowMatrix.java and enter a prime row, in the form of integers ranging from 0-11 (0 representing C, 1 representing C#, etc.), and press enter when finished. The intervals between each pitch in the row, in half steps descending, will be displayed along with the matrix.
